# TODO

- use css module or styled component for styling instead of inline styled
- UI improvement (better responsiveness and component alignment): upgrade material-ui to the lastest version or at least 1.xx
- should connect redux to component directly instead of passing actions from root component. Use containers for this
- adopt airbnb eslint configration
